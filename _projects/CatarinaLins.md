> "voice <br>
 <br>
travels so many places before reaching us<br>
 <br>
and you said this would happen<br>
 <br>
before leaving<br>
 <br>
when you read<br>
 <br>
in an anthology of modern poetry<br>
 <br>
something like this: what is normal, in a world of sound, <br>
 <br>
is to maintain continuity<br>
 <br>
but you know we’re not in a world of sound<br>
 <br>
don’t you?"
