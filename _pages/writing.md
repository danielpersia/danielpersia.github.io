I write, edit and translate for a variety of news outlets and publications. I look for **(1) initaitves that bring local and global ideas into conversation, (2) projects that challenge the way we think about language and identity,** and **(3) events that foreground the perspectives of historically marginalized communities.** I have a passion for generating thought leadership through community events, in dialogue with participants and presenters.

## Espalhe Lima / Hearing Lima 

![](/images/lima.jpg)

>“What was gnawing at me was the silence” 

Hearing Lima is an invitation to revisit the life and work of Brazilian writer Lima Barreto upon the centennial of his death in November 1922.

Throughout 2022, renowned artists, writers and researchers, black men and women of various nationalities, will read excerpts of his work, giving body and voice to a modernist who has long been excluded and silenced— but who remains extremely relevant today. Marking 100 years since Brazilian Modern Art Week, this is also an opportunity to revisit a writer from Rio de Janeiro who was left out of the predominant São Paulo scene. Organized by the Brazil LAB and Companhia das Letras, Hearing Lima seeks to share Lima Barreto’s legacy through video, image and text in a publicly accessible, bilingual format.<sup>2<sup>

## Asymptote Journal

![](/images/Asymptote.jpg)

Winner of the 2015 London Book Fair's International Literary Translation Initiative Award, [*Asymptote*](https://www.asymptotejournal.com) is the premier site for world literature in translation. We take our name from the dotted line on a graph that a mathematical function may tend toward, but never reach. Similarly, a translated text may never fully replicate the effect of the original; it is its own creative act.

### Book Reviews

[*Minor Detail*](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2020/05/28/announcing-our-may-book-club-selection-minor-detail-by-adania-shibli/) by Adania Shibli, translated by Elisabeth Jaquette (New Directions, 2020)

A novelistic reflection on the violent and painful consequences of the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts, from the War of 1948 to present day.

[*Include Me Out*](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2020/02/17/whats-new-in-translation-february-2020/) by María Sonia Cristoff, translated by Katherine Silver (Transit Books, 2020)

Simultaneous interpreter Mara  moves to a provincial town in Argentina to speak as little as possible for a year. 

[*The Sun on My Head*](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2019/06/17/20726/) by Geovani Martins, translated by Julia Sanches (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2019)

Geovani Martins recounts the experiences of boys growing up in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro in the early years of the twenty-first century.

[*Welcome to America*](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2019/09/16/whats-new-in-translation-september-2019/) by Linda Boström Nausgard, translated by Martin Aitken (World Editions, 2019)

Ellen has stopped talking. She thinks she may have killed her dad. Her brother’s barricaded himself in his room. Their mother, a successful actress, carries on as normal. We’re a family of light! she insists. But darkness seeps in everywhere and in their separate worlds each of them longs for togetherness.

[*Arid Dreams*](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2019/04/15/whats-new-in-translation-april-2019/) by Duanwad Pimwana, translated by Mui Poopoksakul (Feminist Press, 2019)

In thirteen stories that investigate ordinary and working-class Thailand, characters aspire for more but remain suspended in routine. They bide their time, waiting for an extraordinary event to end their stasis. A politician’s wife imagines her life had her husband’s accident been fatal, a man on death row requests that a friend clear up a misunderstanding with a sex worker, and an elevator attendant feels himself wasting away while trapped, immobile, at his station all day.

[*Wind and Wood...*](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2019/11/13/wind-and-wood-and-word-sonnets-toward-a-multilingual-tradition-in-translation/) by Seymour Mayne, quadrilingual edition (Malisia Editorial, 2018)

Quadriliingual collection of word sonnets (English, Spanish, French and Portuguese). The second sequence of Mayne’s larger collection, *Cusp: Word Sonnets (2014)*, which marked fifty years since his poetry first appeared in Montreal.  

### Interviews

[Textual Echoes: Elisabeth Jacquette on Translating Adania Shibli's *Minor Detail*](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2020/06/25/textual-echoes-elisabeth-jacquette-on-translating-adania-shiblis-minor-detail/)

As thousands of Palestinians protest against Israel’s newly announced annexation plans for significant parts of the West Bank and Jordan Valley, Adania Shibli’s haunting, persistent novel, *Minor Detail*, seems especially potent as our May Book Club Selection. The text is written in two parts: the first is set in 1949 and details a horrifying act of violence committed by Israeli soldiers, while the second takes place during present day, in which another young woman discovers the crime and makes a place for it within her own life. Daniel Persia speaks to the translator, Elisabeth Jaquette, about how she has rendered this powerful narrative for English-language readers.

[Autoria Negra: An Interview with Cidinha da Silva](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2020/09/07/autoria-negra-an-interview-with-cidinha-da-silva/)

When I first met Cidinha da Silva, I had just begun translating *Sobre-viventes!* (Pallas Editora, 2016), a collection of crônicas on Brazil, past and present. In 2010, Cidinha coined the neologism Exuzilhar, a verb that combines the Portuguese encruzilhar (“to cross”) or encruzilhada (“crossroads”) with Exu (an Orisha in the Yoruba religion, the divine messenger or gatekeeper). 

Exuzilhamento is indeed a driving force of Cidinha’s work, which, as she reveals here, “revolves around Africanities, Orixalities, Ancestralities, and the tension and dialogue between tradition (African, Afro-Brazilian, Afro-Diasporic, and Afro-Indigenous) and contemporaneity.” This interview showcases the complexity of Cidinha’s creative process and her critical place in contemporary Brazilian literature.
