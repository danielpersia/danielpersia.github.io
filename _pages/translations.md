Throughout his career, Eduardo Chillida never stopped questioning everything relevant to his commitment to art. Without intending to create a deliberation parallel to his work, he used writing as a way to keep his thoughts, using notebooks, fragments of paper, and margins of drawings. He did so intermittently, without a pre-established order. They were intimate reflections, handwritten for his own use, destined to preserve the questions to which he repeatedly returned.

Organized by  Brazilian writers Cristina Judar and Fred Di Giacomo, *Pandemonium: 9 Narratives Bridging São Paulo - Berlin* is an anthology that gathers tales by Aline Bei, Cristina Judar, Jorge Ialanji Filholini and Raimundo Neto (representing São Paulo) and Carola Saavedra, Fred Di Giacomo, Alexandre Ribeiro, Karin Hueck and Carsten Regel (representing Berlin).
 
The book, whose art direction was the responsibility of the award-winning Rodolfo França, reflects the times of pandemic - economic crisis and the advance of authoritarianism, highlighting the differences in the impacts of this distopic reality felt both in Brazil and Germany.
