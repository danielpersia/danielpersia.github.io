Hello / Hola / Olá! 

I'm so glad you've found my site. I write and translate from Spanish and Portuguese. Language shapes who I am and how I think about the world.  

When we extend ourselves beyond our first languages, we step into a vulnerability that values other ways of saying, thinking and doing. With over a decade of experience in teaching and learning, ranging from K-20 education to industry and non-profits, I've developed a set of best practices to lead creatively, with intention, across cultures. I've lived and worked across the US, UK, Spain, Brazil and Kenya, among other places.

I hope you'll read my portfolio as an invitation to connect. I'm open to writing, editing and translation jobs (all genres), speaking engagements, and creative collaborations. I also welcome facilitation and consulting in any context where learning is fundamental to driving team success and innovation.

Hope to work together soon! 

Best / abrazos / abraços, 

Danny
