Danny brings a systems thinking approach to organizational development and is committed to long-term vision, sustainability and impact. 

Recently, Danny served as a Reserach Fellow for Princeton University's Brazil LAB (Luso-Afro-Brazilian), a multidsiciplinary teaching and research hub focused on environmentalism, racialized frontiers, and decolongizing/indigenizing the arts. His international leadership extends to central Kenya, where he has led communications, fundraising and donor management for the Mpala Research Centre and Mpala Wildlife Foundation - a non-profit partnership between Princeton, the Smithsonian, and various Kenyan institutions that promotes education and conservation across 48,000 acres of protected land.

As a National Science Foundation Noyce Teaching Fellow, he led curriculum development for discrete mathematics and statistics, implementing Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and Growth Mindset to better engage artists through technology. In collaboration with Math for America, the Education Development Center, and the Insititute for Advanced Study, Danny has contributed to a growing body of research on inquiry-based learning and learner-centered curriculum design.  

Trilingual in Spanish and Portuguese, Danny has long been an advocate for multilingual education.
