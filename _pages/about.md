Hello / hola / olá! 

So glad you've found my site.  I'm a writer and translator from Spanish and Portuguese. I've lived and worked across the US, UK, Spain, Brazil and Kenya, among other places. Language shapes who I am and how I think about our world.  

Translation holds the key to becoming better active listeners, building stronger teams, and truly embracing diverse perspectives. When we extend ourselves beyond our first languages, we step into a vulnerability that values other ways of thinking, saying and doing. With over a decade of experience in teaching and learning, ranging from K-20 education to industry and non-profits, I've developed a set of best practices to lead creatively, with intention, across cultures. 

Please do reach out - I'd love to connect and learn more about you! I'm open to translation jobs (all genres), speaking engagements, creative collaborations, facilitation, and consulting that aims to enhance professional teaching and learning, in any context. 

Hope you my portfolio, looking forward to hearing from you! 

Best / abrazos / abraços, 

Danny
