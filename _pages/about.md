Hello / hola / olá! 

I'm so glad you've found my site. I write and translate from Spanish and Portuguese. I've lived and worked across the US, UK, Spain, Brazil and Kenya, among other places. Language shapes who I am and how I think about the world.  

Multilingualism empowers us to become better active listeners, build stronger teams, and embrace diverse perspectives. When we extend ourselves beyond our first languages, we step into a vulnerability that values other ways of thinking and doing. With over a decade of experience in teaching and learning, ranging from K-20 education to industry and non-profits, I've developed a set of best practices to lead creatively, with intention, across cultures.  

I hope you'll read my portfolio as an invitation to connect- and to share more about your ongoing goals and projects. I'm open to writing, editing and translation jobs (all genres), speaking engagements, and creative collaborations. I also welcome consulting in any context (non-profit, industry, education, etc.) where learning and development are fundamental to driving team success and innovation.

Hope to work together soon! 

Best / abrazos / abraços, 

Danny
