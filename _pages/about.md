Hello / hola / olá! 

So glad you've found my site.  I'm a writer and translator from Spanish and Portuguese. I've lived and worked across the US, UK, Spain, Brazil and Kenya, among other places. Language shapes who I am and how I think about the world.  

Translation and multilingualism hold the key to becoming better active listeners, building stronger teams, and embracing diverse perspectives. When we extend ourselves beyond our first languages, we step into a vulnerability that values other ways of thinking and doing. With over a decade of experience in teaching and learning, ranging from K-20 education to industry and non-profits, I've developed a set of best practices to lead creatively, with intention, across cultures. 

I hope my portfolio invites you to reach out- and to say more about your ongoing projects! I'm open to writing, editing and translation jobs (all genres), speaking engagements, and creative collaborations. I also welcome consulting  in any context where learning and development are fundamental to driving team success and innovation.

Looking forward to hearing from you! 

Best / abrazos / abraços, 

Danny
