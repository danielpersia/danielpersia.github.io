I'm a trilingual writer, storyteller and public speaker. 

I spend my time thinking about how emotional intelligence, empathy, and intercultural communication can redfine teambuilding and team success in both the non-profit and corporate sectors. 

I am currently finishing a PhD in languages from Princeton University. My research focuses on cross-cultural communication and how translators, in particular, navigate the complex space between their own identities and the writers they translate. I've been collaborating at the intersection of education, language and internationalization for the last decade, with expertise across the Atlantic (Americas-Europe-Africa) and a deep interest in the impact of new and emerging technologies. 

As an international educator and language pracitcioner, I have experience in high-level global strategy and local community development. I bring a range of qualitative and quantitative research skills that span the social sciences, natural sciences and Humanities, always with an eye toward on-the-ground impact.
