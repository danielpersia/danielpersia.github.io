I'm a trilingual writer, storyteller and public speaker. 

I spend my time thinking about how emotional intelligence, empathy, and intercultural communication can redefine teambuilding and team success in both the non-profit and corporate sectors. 

I'm an avid language learner. I believe that learning a language is not only about writing, reading and speaking, but, more importantly, about thinking through another cultural system. When we extend ourselves beyond our native language(s), we embrace a vulnerability that values other ways of saying, thinking and doing. 

I am currently finishing a PhD in languages from Princeton University. My research focuses on cross-cultural communication, and how translators navigate the complex space between their own identities and those they translate. I've been collaborating at the intersection of education, language and internationalization for the last decade, with expertise across the Atlantic (Americas-Europe-Africa) and a deep interest in the impact of new and emerging technologies. 

As an educator and language practitioner, I have experience in high-level global strategy and local development. I bring a range of qualitative and quantitative research skills that span the social sciences, natural sciences and humanities, always with an eye toward community impact.
