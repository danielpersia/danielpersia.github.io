I'm a trilingual writer, storyteller and translator. 

I spend my time thinking about how emotional intelligence, empathy, and intercultural communication can redefine teambuilding and team success in both the public and private sectors. 

I am currently finishing a PhD in languages from Princeton University. My research focuses on cross-cultural communication, and how translators navigate the complex space between their own identities and those they translate. I've been collaborating at the intersection of education, language and internationalization for the last decade, with expertise across the Atlantic (Americas-Europe-Africa) and a deep interest in the impact of new and emerging technologies.
