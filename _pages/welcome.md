Hello! 

Thanks so much for visiting my site. I'm a writer and translator from Spanish and Portuguese (and a bit of French and Italian). I've lived in the US, UK, Spain and Brazil, among other places. Language and culture shape who I am and how I think about the world.  

For the past 10 years, I've been collaborating at the intersection of education, technology and internationalization. I started as a STEAM educator at the [Boston Arts Academy](https://bostonartsacademy.org), then went on to become Regional Lead for the [US-Brazil Fulbright Commission](https://fulbright.org.br), in Curitiba, Paraná. I've also worked with [Apple](https://www.apple.com) as  a Creative and Product Specialist, helping end users access the right knowledge and technology to pursue their creative dreams. 

I'm currently finishing a [PhD in Spanish and Portuguese at Princeton University](https://spo.princeton.edu/people/daniel-persia-g-2), where I study translation ethics and the overlap between translator and author identities. On my site you'll find samples of my work with [*Asymptote Journal*](https://www.asymptotejournal.com), Princeton's [Brazil LAB](https://brazillab.princeton.edu) (Luso-Afro-Brazilian Studies), and various other print and digital publications. I've also served as a fellow for the [Program in Latin American Studies](https://plas.princeton.edu/people/daniel-persia), the [Center for Digital Humanities](https://cdh.princeton.edu/people/daniel-persia/), and Princeton's [International Affairs & Operations](https://provost.princeton.edu/what-we-do/international-affairs-operations) team. 

I believe that translation holds the key to becoming better active listeners, building stronger teams, and  embracing diverse perspectives. I'm looking forward to sharing more of my artistic portfolio and thinking here, as I continue to add to the site. Please do reach out - I'd love to connect and learn more about you! I am also open to translation jobs (all genres), speaking engagements, and creative collaborations. 

Best / abrazos / abraços, 

Danny / Dani
