Winner of the 2015 London Book Fair's International Literary Translation Initiative Award, [*Asymptote*](https://www.asymptotejournal.com) is the premier site for world literature in translation. We take our name from the dotted line on a graph that a mathematical function may tend toward, but never reach. Similarly, a translated text may never fully replicate the effect of the original; it is its own creative act.

[*Welcome to America*](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2019/09/16/whats-new-in-translation-september-2019/) by Linda Boström Nausgard, translated by Martin Aitken (World Editions, 2019)

Ellen has stopped talking. She thinks she may have killed her dad. Her brother’s barricaded himself in his room. Their mother, a successful actress, carries on as normal. We’re a family of light! she insists. But darkness seeps in everywhere and in their separate worlds each of them longs for togetherness.

[*Arid Dreams*](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2019/04/15/whats-new-in-translation-april-2019/) by Duanwad Pimwana, translated by Mui Poopoksakul (Feminist Press, 2019)

In thirteen stories that investigate ordinary and working-class Thailand, characters aspire for more but remain suspended in routine. They bide their time, waiting for an extraordinary event to end their stasis. A politician’s wife imagines her life had her husband’s accident been fatal, a man on death row requests that a friend clear up a misunderstanding with a sex worker, and an elevator attendant feels himself wasting away while trapped, immobile, at his station all day.

[*Wind and Wood...*](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2019/11/13/wind-and-wood-and-word-sonnets-toward-a-multilingual-tradition-in-translation/) by Seymour Mayne, quadrilingual edition (Malisia Editorial, 2018)

Quadriliingual collection of word sonnets (English, Spanish, French and Portuguese). The second sequence of Mayne’s larger collection, *Cusp: Word Sonnets (2014)*, which marked fifty years since his poetry first appeared in Montreal.  

## Interviews

[Textual Echoes: Elisabeth Jacquette on Translating Adania Shibli's *Minor Detail*](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2020/06/25/textual-echoes-elisabeth-jacquette-on-translating-adania-shiblis-minor-detail/)

As thousands of Palestinians protest against Israel’s newly announced annexation plans for significant parts of the West Bank and Jordan Valley, Adania Shibli’s haunting, persistent novel, *Minor Detail*, seems especially potent as our May Book Club Selection. The text is written in two parts: the first is set in 1949 and details a horrifying act of violence committed by Israeli soldiers, while the second takes place during present day, in which another young woman discovers the crime and makes a place for it within her own life. Daniel Persia speaks to the translator, Elisabeth Jaquette, about how she has rendered this powerful narrative for English-language readers.

[Autoria Negra: An Interview with Cidinha da Silva](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2020/09/07/autoria-negra-an-interview-with-cidinha-da-silva/)

When I first met Cidinha da Silva, I had just begun translating *Sobre-viventes!* (Pallas Editora, 2016), a collection of crônicas on Brazil, past and present. In 2010, Cidinha coined the neologism Exuzilhar, a verb that combines the Portuguese encruzilhar (“to cross”) or encruzilhada (“crossroads”) with Exu (an Orisha in the Yoruba religion, the divine messenger or gatekeeper). 

Exuzilhamento is indeed a driving force of Cidinha’s work, which, as she reveals here, “revolves around Africanities, Orixalities, Ancestralities, and the tension and dialogue between tradition (African, Afro-Brazilian, Afro-Diasporic, and Afro-Indigenous) and contemporaneity.” This interview showcases the complexity of Cidinha’s creative process and her critical place in contemporary Brazilian literature.
